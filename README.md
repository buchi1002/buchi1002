# $\text{Welcome to Buchi's Home}$

I'm interested in a matroid theory, a coding theory, and a combinatrial optimization.

Sometimes, I'm joining programming competition AtCoder.

Let $E$ be the all information in the world and a subset $S$ of $E$ be the collection of topics in my github.

## Some topics in $S$

- Symplectic Matroids.

- $q$-analogue of combinatorial pregeometry a.k.a. $q$-matroids.

- Solutions for AtCoder Problems.

## Some topics in $E \setminus S$

- The secret to sleeping deeply and waking up refreshed.

- How to Make up with Your Partner.
